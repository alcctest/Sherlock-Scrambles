Hello World
# 🕸️ Sherlock's Scrambles Project

Welcome to the *Sherlock's Scrambles** project! This guide will help you get started with the codebase, install dependencies, set up your environment, and begin contributing to the project. Let's build something awesome together! 🕹️

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Install Dependencies
Run one of the following commands to install the required packages:
```bash
npm install  
or  
yarn install  
or  
pnpm install

### Set Up Environment Variables

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local`. Here's a sample of what your `.env.local` should look like:
```

To generate a random `AUTH_SECRET`, simply run:

```bash
